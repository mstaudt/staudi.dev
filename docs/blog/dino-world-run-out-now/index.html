After six months of hard work, it’s finally happening: Dino World Run is officially released for Android! 🎉
In this game you play a cute little dino on an epic adventure through hand-drawn worlds. From the overgrown jungle to the scorched volcanic plains and dark caves, many challenging obstacles and lovingly designed levels await you. Challenge yourself and break your own highscore!
The game is made with the Godot game engine. I had a lot of fun learning how to set up and structure a game. As I had never really drawn before, I learned on-the-go how to create assets using ProCreate on an iPad.">

<p>After six months of hard work, it’s finally happening: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.braffdev.dinorun"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dino World Run</a> is officially released for Android! 🎉</p>
<p>In this game you play a cute little dino on an epic adventure through hand-drawn worlds. From the overgrown jungle to the scorched volcanic plains and dark caves, many challenging obstacles and lovingly designed levels await you. Challenge yourself and break your own highscore!</p>
<p>The game is made with the <a href="https://godotengine.org/"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Godot game engine</a>. I had a lot of fun learning how to set up and structure a game. As I had never really drawn before, I learned on-the-go how to create assets using ProCreate on an iPad.</p>
<p>For marketing reasons I have created a separate website for the game: <a href="https://dinorun.app"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dinorun.app</a>. Give it a visit for further details on the game.</p>
